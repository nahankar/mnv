Project: AI Content Generation Pipeline for MnV
Version: 1.0
Date: 28-Aug-2025
Authors: MnV Architect
1. System Overview
**Purpose**: Automate the generation, production, distribution, and monetization of AI-generated content (short stories → narrated videos → uploaded to platforms).
**Scope**: End-to-end pipeline covering content generation, video assembly, platform uploads, analytics, optimization, and monetization.
**Exclusions**: Manual editing, live interaction, or custom creative writing beyond AI output.
**Stakeholders**: Content creators, social media managers, platform admins, dev/ops teams.
**Constraints**: Dependent on multiple third-party APIs, Internet + GPU required for image/video generation, Costs per video: $0.26–0.85.
2. Functional Requirements
FR1: Content Generation – Auto-generate stories (300–500 words), narration, images, and music. Retry logic (3 retries on API failure).
FR2: Video Production – Assemble videos in 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 formats with transitions, overlays, and color correction.
FR3: Platform Distribution – Upload to YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook with retry logic and logs.
FR4: Monetization – Support creator funds, ad revenue, affiliate links, eBooks, Patreon/Ko-fi integration.
FR5: Analytics & Optimization – Track engagement, revenue, suggest strategy changes (ML-based).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Pipeline ≤10 min/video; story generation ≤30s.
Reliability: ≥99% uptime; auto-retry on failures.
Scalability: Horizontal scaling on Kubernetes/Docker.
Security: API key encryption, rate limiting.
Compliance: GDPR, COPPA, copyright moderation.
Maintainability: ≥80% test coverage, linting.
Cost: Alert if >$1/video.
4. Data Models
Story: {id, content, genre, theme, length, created_at}
Video: {id, story_id, format, path, status}
Upload: {id, video_id, platform, url, metrics}
Analytics: {id, upload_id, engagement_json, revenue, timestamp}
5. Interfaces & APIs
Internal APIs: POST /generate/story, POST /assemble/video, POST /upload/{platform}, GET /analytics/{video_id}.
External APIs: OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, ElevenLabs, Mubert, DALL-E, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook.
6. Architecture
Hybrid Architecture: Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Airflow/Prefect orchestration, PostgreSQL + Redis, Prometheus + Grafana monitoring, Docker/Kubernetes deployment.
7. Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: Core modules.
Integration Tests: End-to-end with mocks.
E2E Tests: Full pipeline runs.
Acceptance Tests: Verify FR1–FR5.
Performance Tests: Simulate 100 videos/day.
Security Tests: API keys, rate limits.
8. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Core pipeline with YouTube uploads.
Phase 2 (Weeks 3–4): Multi-platform + basic analytics.
Phase 3 (Weeks 5–8): Monetization + optimization.
Phase 4 (Ongoing): Risk mgmt, scaling, cost optimization.
9. Risk Mitigation
Content Risks: Filters, copyright checks, moderation queue.
Technical Risks: API fallback chains, retries, multi-region deployment.
Business Risks: Diversify platforms, adjust to policy shifts.
10. Success Metrics
Content: Completion >40%, engagement >5%.
Technical: Error rate <2%, recovery <5 min.
Business: Revenue/video ≥$0.50, MRR growth ≥10%/mo.
